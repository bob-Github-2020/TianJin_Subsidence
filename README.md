I use this site to archieve some data and figure files for a recent paper:

Xiao Yu, Guoquan Wang, Xie Hu, Yuhao Liu, and Yan Bao (2022). Land subsidence in Tianjin, China: before and after the South-to-North Water Diversion (usbmitted to Geophysical Research Letter)

GPS-derived daily subsidence time series at five sites (JIXN, TJBD, TJBH, TJWQ, QING) in Tianjin and one site (HECX) in Cangzhou, Hebei Province. The locations of these GPS sites are marked in Figure 1.

Water supplies in Tianjin from 2010 to 2021. The total water supply transformed to Tianjin by the South-to-North Water Diversion (SNWD) project is approximately 7 billion m3 from 2015 to 2021. (Data source: Tianjin Water Resources Bulletins, 2010 to 2021).

The water uses in Tianjin during 2014 and 2021. The South-to-North Water Diversion (SNWD) project began to divert Yangtze water to Tianjin in the end of 2014. (Data source: Tianjin Water Resources Bulletin, 2014 and 2021). This figure was plotted by the Python program: TJ_GWUse_Pier.py
