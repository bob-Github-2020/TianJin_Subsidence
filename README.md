Water supplies in Tianjin from 2010 to 2021. The total water supply transformed to Tianjin by the South-to-North Water Diversion (SNWD) project is approximately 7 billion m3 from 2015 to 2021. (Data source: Tianjin Water Resources Bulletins, 2010 to 2021).

The water uses in Tianjin during 2014 and 2021. The South-to-North Water Diversion (SNWD) project began to divert Yangtze water to Tianjin in the end of 2014. (Data source: Tianjin Water Resources Bulletin, 2014 and 2021). This figure was plotted by the Python program: TJ_GWUse_Pier.py
